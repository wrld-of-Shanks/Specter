## Known Limitations

### 1. Offline Limitations
**Note:** The system runs in retrieval-only mode — summarization and translation features are not available.

**Workaround:** 
- Situation-aware template responses provide structured legal guidance without LLM
- Document type identification works for common types
- Error messages guide users when features are unavailable

**Future Enhancement:**
- Implement local inference for summarization
- Add caching for common queries

### 2. OCR Dependency
**Issue:** Tesseract and Poppler must be installed on the system.

**Workaround:**
- Clear error messages when OCR tools are missing
- Digital PDFs work without OCR
- Installation guide provided

**Future Enhancement:**
- Use cloud-based OCR services
- Provide Docker image with all dependencies

### 3. Usage Limits
**Issue:** Free tier users have limited uploads and queries.

**Workaround:**
- Clear messaging about limits
- Upgrade modal shown when limit reached
- Admin accounts for testing

**Future Enhancement:**
- Implement usage reset functionality
- Add more flexible subscription tiers

## Recommendations

### For Development
1. **Install OCR Tools** for image processing
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install tesseract poppler
   
   # Ubuntu
   sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr poppler-utils
   ```

3. **Setup MongoDB** for authentication and usage tracking
   - Use MongoDB Atlas for cloud deployment
   - Use local MongoDB for development

### For Production Deployment
1. **Use Environment Variables** for all configuration
2. **Enable HTTPS** for secure communication
3. **Implement Rate Limiting** to prevent abuse
4. **Add Monitoring** for system health
5. **Setup Logging** for debugging
6. **Use CDN** for frontend assets
7. **Implement Caching** for common queries

### For Testing
1. **Run Test Suite** before deployment
   ```bash
   python3 backend/test_system.py
   ```

2. **Manual Testing** of critical features
   - Document upload
   - Summarization
   - Verification
   - Chat functionality

3. **Load Testing** for production readiness
   - Test with multiple concurrent users
   - Verify response times
